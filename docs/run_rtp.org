AIRS, CrIS, and IASI follow a fairly common foundation. IASI is still
a bit different as I have not refactored Chris' original code to fully
match the AIRS/CrIS paradigm (which itself isn't as fully one paradigm
as I'd like). Where they are similar is in the use of a driver file to
specify the paths to either granule files directly (for allfov) or to
a day of granules for clear/random/site/dcc. So, the general flow for
rtps is to build the required driver file and then kick off jobs on
the cluster. Each individual cluster job can then pull in the
appropriate path to get started. AIRS and CrIS have additionally moved
on to having configuration files in which runtime options are
specified. So, things like klayers/sarta executable paths are
specified here, co2ppm overrides are specified here, etc. I keep these
ini and driver files in a separate git repo (~/git/rtp_config) to help
with traceability. Between commits and annotated tags, what was run
and when is tracked. These could be tracked within rtp_prod2, I just
found it cleaner for parsing the git histories to separate them out.

I have also taken to keeping two working copies of the rtp_prod2 repo
active. One is my /production/ repo and I try to run all production
from it. the other is named rtp_prod2_DEV and is where I try to do all
development. Trying to do development and production out of a single
repo with rollback checkouts, branches, etc. just got unwieldy. I try
to not use branches in the development repo but only because branch
changes are not always as clean as one might hope. If I ever roll back
the production repo, I always do it through a branch and then reset
hard when reverting back to HEAD. My usual workflow is develop and
test in rtp_prod2_DEV -> add/commit and push to github -> pull down to
rtp_prod2 -> run production.

* AIRS
- find (or build) appropriate ini file (see examples in
  rtp_prod2/airs/config or rtp_config/rtp/airs)
- build driver list of file paths
  - for allfov, this is paths directly to each granule (e.g. ls -1
    /asl/data/airs/L1C_v672/2018/012/*.hdf)
  - for daily, paths to each doy (e.g. ls -1d /asl/data/airs/L1C_v672/2018/* for a year) 
- in rtp_prod2/airs/scripts, run sbatch with the appropriate run*.sh
  script (e.g. for clear: sbatch --array=0-N
  run_airicrad_clear_day_batch.sh <path-to-ini-file> where 'N' is the
  number of lines in the driver file-1)

* CrIS
- find (or build) appropriate ini file (see examples in
  rtp_prod2/cris/config or rtp_config/rtp/cris)
- build driver list of file paths
  - for allfov, this is paths directly to each granule (e.g. ls -1
    /asl/cris/ccast/sdr45_npp_HR/2018/104/*.mat)
  - for daily, paths to each doy (e.g. ls -1d /asl/cris/ccast/sdr45_npp_HR/2018/* for a year) 
- in rtp_prod2/cris/scripts, run sbatch with the appropriate run*.sh
  script (e.g. for clear: sbatch --array=0-N
  run_cris_hr_clear_day_batch.sh <path-to-ini-file> where 'N' is the
  number of lines in the driver file-1)


* IASI
- batch_iasi_rtp('2018/01', 'clear')
  - builds two files in ./run: 
    - *.slurm  sbatch commands
    - *_drv.mat  list of dates within month

- sbatch batch_iasi1_201801_clear_rtp.slurm 
  - sbatch --array=1-5 batch_iasi1_201801_clear_rtp.slurm   to run just a couple
  - sbatch --array=1,2,6,7-9 batch_iasi1_201801_clear_rtp.slurm  to run fill-ins
  - sbatch --time=09:00:00 batch_iasi1_201801_clear_rtp.slurm to adjust run time request
  - rtp files output to /asl/rtp/rtp_iasi1 tree (path hardcoded in run_iasi1_rtp.m)
