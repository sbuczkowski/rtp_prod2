* Introduction

=rtp-prod= creates blah blah

In order to run kcmix, the user also needs to install/download
1) hdf packages
2) rtp package, which is our native file format for storing
   atmospheric geophysical variables and instrument view geometry
   parameters, needed for RT calculations
3) klayers package, which takes in a LEVELS rtp file and produces a LAYERS 
   average rtp file, needed for RT calculations

* Main Top Level Routines

This is all junk filler.

- kcrad :: Radiative transfer top-level wrapper, manages defaults and
           loops on chunks, calling kcmix2, contcalc, and rtchunk

- rtchunk :: Radiative transfer calc's in 10^4 point chunks, including
             reflected solar and basic reflected thermal

- kcmix2 :: Calculates 25 1/cm chunks of mixed absorptions for a
            supplied profile, from tabulated compressed absorptions

- kcmix100 :: Version of kcmix that assumes a 100-layer input profile
              with the same layers as the reference profiles

- contcalc :: Continuum calculation from kcarta tabulated values

* Documentation

Documentation is available in the =docs= subdirectory, and is fairly
up-to-date.
