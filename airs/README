* AIRS airicrad clear subset rtp production by day
create_airicrad_clear_day_rtp.m 

function [head, hattr, prof, pattr] = create_airicrad_clear_day_rtp(inpath, cfg)

where inpath is the path to the DAY of airs you wish to turn into a
clear subset rtp. e.g. /asl/airs/l1c_v675/2025/008. cfg is a config
structure produced by a call to ini2struct and a configuration file
like that in ./config/airicrad_ecmwf_clear.ini

** single day by hand in matlab:
>> airs_rtpaddpaths
>> inpath='/asl/airs/l1c_v675/2025/008'
>> cfg = ini2struct('./config/airicrad_ecmwf_clear.ini')
>> [h,ha,p,pa] = create_airicrad_clear_day_rtp(inpath,cfg);

The sample ini file ./config/airicrad_ecmwf_clear.ini should suffice
for most clear subset work, especially is running single days by hand.
