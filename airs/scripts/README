* running airs clear for more than one day at a time (slurm batch)

  - batch runs key off two files: a configuration file and a drive
    file with paths to days to process

    - create list of days to process (does not have to be consecutive
      days or ordered in any particular way)

      e.g. days 2024/048-050 
      /asl/airs/l1c_v675/2024/: 
      ls -d1 /asl/airs/l1c_v675/2024/{048,049,050} >> ../config/airs_days_to_process

      The path to this driver file needs to be noted in the
      configuration file you will be using as the value for the "file_list" key

      airs_days_to_process, then, contains lines like:
         /asl/airs/l1c_v675/2024/048
         /asl/airs/l1c_v675/2024/049
         /asl/airs/l1c_v675/2024/050

      Note the number of lines in the driver file i.e.
         wc -l ../config/airs_days_to_process

      this will be needed in the sbatch call array parameters

    - make sure your config file file_list key points to your file list...

    - run sbatch
      sbatch --array=0-N run_airicrad_clear_day_batch.sh <path to config file> 

      where N is the number of lines in the driver file - 1
      <path to config file> is the path to your config file

** how it all comes together
assuming the above for creation of a driver file and assuming the
configuration file is ../config/airicrad_ecmwf_clear.ini, this comes together as:

sbatch --array=0-2 run_airicrad_clear_day_batch.sh ../config/airicrad_ecmwf_clear.ini

This will try to get three nodes on the cluster each running a day from the driver file.

The default sbatch options in run_airicrad_clear_day_batch.sh are to
run in the medium+ QOS for 3hrs 59min. Under normal use, I find this
to be almost twice what I actually need.

** Running large numbers of days
I find it very beneficial to do a couple things when running large
numbers of days (let's say a year)

   - throttle back the sbatch array request (i.e. --array=0-364%20) I
     find it best to run 20-40 days at a time. above that, there tends
     to be some resource contention and things slow down. You can let
     sbatch just run and figure everything out on its own but will
     likely run long and quite likely overrun the 3:59:00 time
     request. Which brings me to:

   - do a test run first, say, 5 days to see how the cluster is
     running. If they run slow, it might be advisable to adjust the
     time request

     sbatch --array=0-5 run_airicrad_clear_day_batch.sh ../config/airicrad_ecmwf_clear.ini
   
     - if this runs slow, adjust time for rest;
       sbatch --array=6-364%20 --time=05:00:00 run_airicrad_clear_day_batch.sh ../config/airicrad_ecmwf_clear.ini

     - if it seems to be running fine
       sbatch --array=6-364%20 run_airicrad_clear_day_batch.sh ../config/airicrad_ecmwf_clear.ini
